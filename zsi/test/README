These tests are in the process of being incorporated in pyunit. Not all errors
are currently being caught by pyunit, so it is still necessary to check the
output of the code by hand.

Two top level modules have been provided to run the tests. "test_zsi.py" is used
to run all of the local tests. "test_zsi_net.py" is used to run all of the zsi
tests including those that require network access.
