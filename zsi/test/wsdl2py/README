There are two sets of tests in this directory.
One set of tests is contained in test_wsdl2py.py,
and tests the generation and compilation of code
(the services and types files).

By default, tests are done against WSDL's in all
relevant sections in config.txt (no_schemas,
simple_types, and complex_types).  To run
against just a specific section, run for
example:  test_wsdl2py.py complex_types

Note that since all services are not always
available, connection timeouts and HTTP errors
are not treated as test failures.

Generated code is located in the sub-directory
generatedCode.  Subsequent runs will do
diff's against the currently generated code to
see if there are any differences (this is
primarily of interest to developers).

------------------

The other set tests remote method calls on
individual services.  To add individual
service tests, add an entry to the
individual_tests section in config.txt, and
use one of the existing individual tests as
a template.  To test all individual services,
run testall.py

Test result files are generated in the diffs
sub-directory.  Subsequent runs of the
test are compared against previous output.
An AssertionError may result for reasons other
than test failure, for example, if the previous
test did not complete properly.  In that case
run with the -d option to skip the diff's test.

In the case (often) where results from a
test method vary, its section is not written
to the results file.  Instead, the output
is printed out.  In that case it may be useful
to redirect the output to a file, since the
output may be lengthy.

Some remote method calls, particularly
test_SBGGetAirFareQuote in SBGAirFareQuoteTest
may take awhile to return.
