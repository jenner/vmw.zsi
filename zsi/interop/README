This directory includes a server that implements the SOAPBUILDERS
interoperability test.  For details, see http://www.xmethods.net/ilab/

The client.py program will send pre-formatted test packets to a server.
I have not done generic client test, for a couple of reasons:
    Too hard to keep track of all the endpoints; and
    The server already exercises all the code -- it parses and serializes
