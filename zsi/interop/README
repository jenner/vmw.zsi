This directory includes a server that implements "Round 2" interoperability
testing.  More information is available from:
    The soapbuilders mailing list, a forum for people creating SOAP
    implementations.  See http://yahoogroups.com/group/soapbuilders

    An "invitation to join the testing" message can be found at

The client.py program will send pre-formatted test packets to a server.
I have not done generic client test, for a couple of reasons:
    Too hard to keep track of all the endpoints; and
    I'm not good at writing corner-case tests that stretch the limits
    The server already exercises all the code -- it parses and serializes
    There are several other clients out there already
