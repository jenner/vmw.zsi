ZSI, the Zolera SOAP Infrastructure, is a pure-Python module that
provides an implementation of SOAP messaging, as described in The
SOAP 1.1 Specification (see http://www.w3.org/TR/soap).  It can also
be used to build applications using SOAP Messages with Attachments.
(see http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments) ZSI is intended to make it
easier to write web services in Python.

In particular, ZSI parses and generates SOAP messages, and converts
between native Python datatypes and SOAP syntax. Simple dispatch and
invocation methods are supported.  There are no known bugs.  It's only
known limitation is that it cannot handle multi-dimensional arrays.

ZSI is built on top of DOM.  It requires Python 2.0 or later, and PyXML
0.6 or later.  It is open source.  We hope you find it useful, and would
be pleased to receive any feedback (email zsi@zolera.com).

For examples of ZSI in real-world use, please see our products listed
at http://www.zolera.com.

The documentation (in PDF and HTML) is accurate, although there are
some formatting nits (such as page numbers being omitted, section
numbers being a little silly, etc).  We should probably restructure the
document as a HOWTO.  You probably can't usefully edit the docs without
having the Python2.0 sources and some other utilities (TeX, pdfLaTeX,
latex2html) on a Unix box.  If you do, then edit doc/Makefile to point
to your distribution.

...and if you ever need XML Digital Signatures (or other XML security
features), drop us a line (email info@zolera.com).
