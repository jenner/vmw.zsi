\centerline{\strong{ABSTRACT}}

\module{ZSI}, the Zolera SOAP Infrastructure, is a Python package that
provides an implementation of SOAP messaging, as described in
\citetitle[http://www.w3.org/TR/soap]{The SOAP 1.1 Specification}.
In particular, \module{ZSI} parses and generates SOAP messages, and
converts between native Python datatypes and SOAP syntax.
It can also be used to build applications using
\citetitle[http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP-attachments]{SOAP Messages with
Attachments}.
\module{ZSI} is ``transport neutral'', and provides only a simple
I/O and dispatch framework; a more complete solution is the
responsibility of the application using \module{ZSI}.
As usage patterns emerge, and common application frameworks are
more understood, this may change.

\module{ZSI} requires Python 2.0 or later and PyXML version 0.6.6 or later.

\chapter{ZSI Schema}

The \ZSI{} schema defines two sets of elements.  One is used to enhance
the SOAP Fault \code{detail} element, and to report header errors.
The other is used to define a header element containing a name and
password, for a class of basic authentication.
