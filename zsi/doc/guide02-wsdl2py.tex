\chapter{WSDL/XMLSchema python code generation}

Handling XML Schema (see \citetitle[http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema]{XML Schema specification}) 
is one of the more difficult aspects of using WSDL.  
Using wsdl2py generates a module with stub code for the client interface,
and a "types" module that contains typecode representations of the XML Schema types and elements.  The generated typecodes are registered in a global schema instance, and once the "types" module is imported by an application all the global elements declarations and type definitions are available everywhere (see section ??).

\subsection{Basics of Code Generation}
\label{subsection:Basics of Code Generation}

\subsubsection{client stub module}
Using only the {\it General Flags} options one can generate a 
{\bfseries client stub module} from a WSDL description, consisting of
representations of the WSDL information items {\it service}, {\it binding}, 
{\it portType}, and {\it message}.


These four items are represented by three abstractions, consisting of a
{\it \bfseries Locator} class, {\it \bfseries PortType} class, and several 
{\it \bfseries Message} classes. The {\it \bfseries Locator} will have two methods for each {\it service port} declared in
the WSDL definition.  One method returns the address specified in the {\it binding}, and the other is a factory method for returning a {\it \bfseries PortType}
instance.  Each {\it \bfseries Message} class represents the aspects of the {\it binding}
at the operation level and below, and any type information specified by {\it message part} items.

\subsubsection{types module}
The {\bfseries types module} is generated with the {\bfseries client module} but
it can be created independently.  This is especially useful for dealing with
schema definitions that aren't specified inside of a WSDL document.  

The module level class defintions each represent a unique namespace, they are
simply wrappers for the contents of individual namespaces.  The inner classes
are the typecode representations of global {\it type definitions} (suffix {\it \bfseries _Def}), 
and {\it element declarations} (suffix {\it \bfseries _Dec}).

The majority of users will not need to directly use the items in the 
{\it \bfseries types module}, for more information see 
\label{section:Advanced Usage Patterns}.


\subsection{Typecode Extensions}

\subsubsection{complexType}
\label{subsubsection:complexType}
The {\it complexType} flag provides many conveniences to the programmer
pertaining to all aspects of dealing with complex types through the use of 
metaclasses. This option is the preferred way of generating client bindings and
types with the {\it wsdl2py} command.  The naming conventions used for all the
generated convenince functions make use of the typecode's {\it aname} attribute.
 By default wsdl2py appends an ``\verb!_!'' to the aname of a complex type and
 its elements.  For example, a complex type named ``\verb!employee!'' would have
 aname, ``\verb!_employee!''.

For the descriptions below we will use the following complex types for
reference.  The scenario assumes one is making a remote call to operation, {\it
WolframSearch}, which takes a request of element, {\it WolframSearch} as shown
below. {\small Note: {\it WolframSearchOptions} has been modified for this example.}
\begin{verbatim}
<xsd:complexType name='WolframSearchOptions'>
  <xsd:sequence>
    <xsd:element name='Query' minOccurs='0' maxOccurs='1' type='xsd:string'/>
    <xsd:element name='Limit' minOccurs='0' maxOccurs='1' type='xsd:int'/>
  </xsd:sequence>
  <xsd:attribute name='timeout' type='xsd:double' />
</xsd:complexType>
<xsd:element name='WolframSearch'>
  <xsd:complexType>
    <xsd:sequence>
      <xsd:element name='Options' minOccurs='0' maxOccurs='1' type='ns1:WolframSearchOptions'/>
    </xsd:sequence>
  </xsd:complexType>
</xsd:element>
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
# Create a request object to operation WolframSearch
#   to be used as an example below
from WolframSearchService_services import *

port = WolframSearchServiceLocator().getWolframSearchmyPortType()
wsreq = WolframSearchRequest()
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[Getters/Setters] A getter and setter function is defined for each element
of a complex type.  The functions are named \verb!get_element_ANAME! and
\verb!set_element_ANAME! respectively.  In this example, variable \var{wsreq}
has functions named \verb!get_element__Options! and \verb!set_element__Options!.
 In addition to elements, getters and setters are generated for the attributes
 of a complex type.  For attributes, just the name of the attribute is used in
 determining the method names, so get_attribute_NAME and set_attribute_NAME are
 created.

\item[Factory Methods] If an element of a complex type is a complex type itself,
then a conveniece factory method is created to get an instance of that types
holder class.  The factory method is named, \verb!newANAME!, so \var{wsreq} has
a factory method, \verb!new_Options!.

\item[Properties]
\citetitle[http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2/descrintro/#property]{Python class properties}
are created for each element of the complex type.  They are mapped to the
corresponding getter and setter for that element.  To avoid name collisions the
properties are named, \verb!PNAME!, where the first letter of the type's pname
attribute is capitalized.  In our running example, \var{wsreq} has class
property, \verb!Options!, which calls functions \verb!get_element__Options! and
\verb!set_element__Options! under the hood.

\end{description}

\begin{verbatim}
# sample usage of the generated code

# get an instance of a Options holder class using factory method
opts = wsreq.new_Options()
wsreq.Options = opts

# assign values using the properties or methods
opts.Query = 'Newton'
opts.set_element__Limit(10)

# don't forget the attribute
opts.set_attribute_timeout(1.0)

# At this point the serialized wsreq object would resemble this:
# <WolframSearch>
#   <Options timeout="1.0" xsi:type="tns:WolframSearchOptions">
#     <Query xsi:type="xsd:string">Newton</Query>
#     <Limit xsi:type="xsd:double">10.0</Limit>
#   </Options>
# </WolframSearch>

# ready call the remote operation
wsresp = port.WolframSearch(wsreq)

# returned WolframSearchResponse type holder also has conveniences
print 'SearchTime:', wsresp.Result.SearchTime
\end{verbatim}

\section{Code Generation from WSDL and XML Schema}

This section covers wsdl2py, the second way ZSI provides to access WSDL
services.  Given the path to a WSDL service, two files are generated, a 
'service' file and a 'types' file, that one can then use to access the
service.  As an example, we will use the search service provided by Wolfram
Research Inc.\copyright{}, \url{http://webservices.wolfram.com/wolframsearch/}, 
which provides a service for searching the popular MathWorld site, 
\url{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/}, among others.

\begin{verbatim}
wsdl2py.py --complexType --url=http://webservices.wolfram.com/services/SearchServices/WolframSearch2.wsdl
\end{verbatim}

Run the above command to generate the service and type files.  wsdl2py uses
the {\it name} attribute of the {\it wsdl:service} element to name the resulting files.
In this example, the service name is {\it WolframSearchService}.  Therefore the files
{\it WolframSearchService_services.py} and {\it WolframSearchService_services_types.py}
should be generated.

The 'service' file contains locator, portType, and message classes.  
A locator instance is used to get an instance of a portType class, 
which is a remote proxy object. Message instances are sent and received 
through the methods of the portType instance.

The 'types' file contains class representations of the definitions and
declarations defined by all schema instances imported by the WSDL definition.
XML Schema attributes, wildcards, and derived types are not fully
handled.

\subsection{Example Use of Generated Code}

The following shows how to call a proxy method for {\it WolframSearch}.  It
assumes wsdl2py has already been run as shown in the section above.  The example
will be explained in greater detail below.

\begin{verbatim}
# import the generated class stubs
from WolframSearchService_services import *

# get a port proxy instance
loc = WolframSearchServiceLocator()
port = loc.getWolframSearchmyPortType()

# create a new request
req = WolframSearchRequest()
req.Options = req.new_Options()
req.Options.Query = 'newton'

# call the remote method
resp = port.WolframSearch(req)

# print results
print 'Search Time:', resp.Result.SearchTime
print 'Total Matches:', resp.Result.TotalMatches
for hit in resp.Result.Matches.Item:
    print '--', hit.Title
\end{verbatim}

Now each section of the code above will be explained.

\begin{verbatim}
from WolframSearchService_services import *
\end{verbatim}

We are primarily interested in the service locator that is imported.  The 
binding proxy and classes for all the messages are additionally imported.
Look at the {\it WolframSearchService_services.py} file for more information.

\begin{verbatim}
loc = WolframSearchServiceLocator()
port = loc.getWolframSearchmyPortType()
\end{verbatim}

Using an instance of the locator, we fetch an instance of the port proxy
which is used for invoking the remote methods provided by the service.  In
this case the default {\it location} specified in the {\it wsdlsoap:address}
element is used.  You can optionally pass a url to the port getter method to
specify an alternate location to be used.  The {\it portType} - {\it name} 
attribute is used to determine the method name to fetch a port proxy instance.
In this example, the port name is {\it WolframSearchmyPortType}, hence the 
method of the locator for fetching the proxy is {\it getWolframSearchmyPortType}.

The first step in calling {\it WolframSearch} is to create a request object
corresponding to the input message of the method.  In this case, the name of
the message is {\it WolframSearchRequest}.  A class representing this message
was imported from the service module.

\begin{verbatim}
req = WolframSearchRequest()
req.Options = req.new_Options()
req.Options.Query = 'newton'
\end{verbatim}

Once a request object is created we need to populate the instance with the
information we want to use in our request.  This is where the {\tt --complexType}
option we passed to wsdl2py will come in handy.  This caused the creation of 
functions for getting and setting elements and attributes of the type, class 
properties for each element, and convenience functions for creating new instances
of elements of complex types.  This functionality is explained in detail in 
subsection~\ref{subsubsection:complexType}.

Once the request instance is populated, calling the remote service is easy.  Using
the port proxy we call the method we are interested in.  An instance of the python
class representing the return type is returned by this call.  The \var{resp} object
can be used to introspect the result of the remote call.

\begin{verbatim}
resp = port.WolframSearch(req)
\end{verbatim}

Here we see that the response message, \var{resp}, represents type {\it WolframSearchReturn}.
This object has one element, {\it Result} which contains the search results for our
search of the keyword, {\tt newton}.

\begin{verbatim}
print 'Search Time:', resp.Result.SearchTime
...
\end{verbatim}

Refer to the wsdl for {\it WolframSearchService} for more details on the returned information.
