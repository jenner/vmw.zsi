Two top level modules have been provided to run the tests. "test_wstools.py" is used
to run all of the local tests. "test_wstools_net.py" is used to run all of the 
tests that require network access.

TESTS:
    test_t1 -- Basic test, just checks that wsdl and xsd objects are in the
	right places.

ADDING TESTS:
    1. For Stand-Alone tests add WSDL FILE to appropriate archive file
        Need to add a NEW Archive?:
            config.py [files] "archive" -- tuple of all archive files, 
            if you need to create a new archive append the archive 
            name to the 'archive' tuple.

    2. Edit config.py section(s):
        option -- name by which service will be referenced in test case.
            Need an entry under appropriate section(s), this name
            must be unique within each section it appears but it may 
            appear in multiple sections.

        config.py "test" sections:
          Stand-Alone --  add "option" under [services_by_file]
		eg. amazon = exports/AmazonWebServices.wsdl

          Network -- add "option" under [services_by_http]
		eg. amazon = http://soap.amazon.com/schemas/AmazonWebServices.wsdl

          Broken -- add "option" under [broken]

    3. In test module(s)
        a. Add test case:

           #eg. test_t1.py 
	   class AmazonTestCase(WSDLToolsTestCase):
		def test(self):
		    self.option = 'amazon'
		    self.loadFromConfig(CONFIG)

        b. Add class name of test case to CASES list.
		CASES = [AirportTestCase,
         		 AmazonTestCase, 
                         .... etc

    4. Done
