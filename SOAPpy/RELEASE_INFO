This release fixes the version string problem Mark Bucciarelli pointed
out, as well as a couple of other bugs.

There are 2 important changes:

1) The new name handling mechanism has been enabled by default.  

   The primary purpose of this release is to allow users to test this
   to see if it causes problems.  Please take the time to do so.  If
   there are no problems reported by April 15, 2003, 0.9.9 will be
   released with this feature enabled by default.

   Note that running a client under an old release of SOAPpy and a
   server under this release will be likely to generate errors due to
   the different name handling mechanisms.

2) MS-Windows systems should now be fully supported.  

   This required implmenting a new module, ieee754, which provides
   functions for detecting and generating IEEE 754 special floating
   point values (+Inf, -Inf, NaN) which are not properly handled by
   the Windows implementation of the float() function.

See the changelog for a detailed list of changes from previous releases.
