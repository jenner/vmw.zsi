This file contains various python scripts for testing SOAPpy.

They all work without generating errors EXCEPT:

- SOAPtest.py  	  Fails the 'testArray' test because I 'referenced' elements are included in the return object.  All other tests pass.
- TCtest.py       All tests fail because something is currently wrong with the parse rules support.  
- storageTest.py  Fails because the hard-coded user/password combination is no longer valid.
