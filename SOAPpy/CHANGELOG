CHANGES: 

VERSION 0.9.7 (6/27/01)
- Fixed the unamed ordered parameters bug
- Added the ability to specify a http_proxy
- Added a patch provided by Tim MiddelKoop to allow printing of proxy objects
- Added the contrib directory and included a medusa implementation of a 
  SOAP.py server by Ng Pheng Siong


VERSION 0.9.6 (6/08/01)

- The date and time types now check their initial values when the type
  is created, not when the data is marshalled.
- The date and time types are now parsed and returned as tuples (for
  multi-element types) or scalars (for single element types) in UTC and thus
  can represent the entire range of SOAP dates.
- If an element doesn't have a type but has a name with a namespace, the
  name is tried as the type.
- Untyped compound types with more than one element and all the elements
  the same name are turned into an array when parsing.
- When parsing a structType, elements with the same name are placed in a
  list instead of saving just the last one. _getItemsAsList can be used to
  get an element of a structure as a list, whether there was one or many
  occurances of the item.
- Added schemaNamespace, schemaNamespaceURI, and namespaceStyle
  configuration options. namespaceStyle takes one of 1999, 2000, or 2001,
  and sets typesNamespace, typesNamespaceURI, schemaNamespace, and
  schemaNamespaceURI.
- Normalized the type class names, replacing Compound with compoundType,
  Struct with structType, Header with headerType, Body with bodyType, Array
  with arrayType, TypedArray with typedArrayType, Fault with faultType, and
  urType with anyType.
- Attributes now appear on an element itself instead of the element's
  parent. For elements parsed to builtin python types, the attributes are
  stored in a dictionary keyed by the element's python id. The dictionary
  is in the Context object, can be returned from parseSOAP*, and can be
  returned from method calls if the returnAllAttrs configuration option
  is set.
- isinstance is used to check for a class, so classes can be subtyped.
- An encoding of None can be specified to not include encoding information.
- Problems with the SOAPProxy URL are now reported when the SOAPProxy
  instance is created instead of when the first method call is made.
- The Binary, Boolean and DateTime types have been removed in favor of
  binaryType, booleanType, and dateTimeType.


VERSION 0.9.5 (5/16/01)

- Should parse and build all 1999, 2000, 2001, and SOAP-ENC datatypes.
- Initial handling of multi-dimensional, partial, and sparse arrays.
- Supports SSL clients (if Python built with OpenSSL).
- Supports SSL servers (if M2Crypto installed).
- Applies defaults to SOAPproxy URLs (nice for command-line tools).
- Added the _SOAPContext object, gives registered server functions more info
  about the current call.
- Now assumes that any type that isn't in a schema could be a struct.
- Added the Config object, now config options can be set globally or on an
  individual call level.
- Deprecated the DateTime, Binary and Boolean types, should now 
  use dateTimeType, binaryType and booleanType.
- Includes N+I interop suite.
- Various bug fixes and improvements.
