SOAP.py

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.9.7

- Modified structure to allow installation using Python distutils
  (i.e. setup.py).  Access to the SOAPpy library now requires: 
     from SOAPpy import SOAP

- I (Gregory R. Warnes) have implemented an experimental and
  non-standard method of handling named and unnamed arguments.  This
  mechanism is enabled in SOAPpy by setting
  SOAPpy.SOAP.Config.specialArgs=1.

  When enabled, parameters with names of the form _#### (i.e.,
  matching the regexp "^_[0-9]+") are assumed to be unnamed parameters
  and are passed to the method in numeric order.  All other parameters
  are assumed to be named and are passed using the xml tag id as the
  parameter name.  Outgoing SOAP method calls now always generate
  names in this way--whether or not specialArgs is enabled--instead of
  using the pattern v#####.  

  See the file README.MethodParameterNaming for more details.

- Added noroot parameter to the SOAPBuilder and SOAPProxy objects
  in order to provide compatibility with an older version of
  EasySOAP (v0.2) that balked if the SOAP-ENC:root parameter was
  included.(Brad Knotwell)

- Added support for namespace-rewriting (used by Apache v2.x SOAP server for
  error conditions as well as stateful communication) (Christopher Blunck)

- Added string <-> str conversion for array types (Python 2.2+)
  (Christopher Blunck)

- Added convenience method (invoke) to SOAPProxy that calls __call (not sure
  if it is necessary - feel free to remove if you want) (Christopher Blunck)

- Python 'float' are equivalent to SOAP 'double'.  Modified dump_float
  and dump_list to use SOAP type string 'double'
  appropriately. (Gregory R. Warnes)

- Add basic authentication (Brad Knotwell)

- Fixes to enble proper handling of SOAP faults by the client:
  - Fixed test of whether message content is text/xml when recieving a fault.
  - Added __call__ method to exception classes to match the current API.
  - The faultType.__repr__() method now print details if present
  (Gregory R. Warnes)

- Added XMLnam.py which provides toXMLname() and fromXMLname() for
  properly encoding xml tag names per the SOAP 2.1 (draft)
  specification. (Gregory R. Warnes)

- Added calls to toXMLname() and fromXMLname() so that tags names are
  properly encoded.  This resolves bug [ 548785 ] 'Error passing dict
  keys containing space.'  (Gregory R. Warnes)

- Added code to cgi encode contents of tags when they are not a
  recognized type.  Fixes bug [ 549551 ] 'Error when passing
  non-standard types'. (Gregory R. Warnes)

- Added __init__.py, so that SOAPpy can be used like a standard python
  module. (Gregory R. Warnes)


VERSION 0.9.7 (6/27/01)
- Fixed the unamed ordered parameters bug
- Added the ability to specify a http_proxy
- Added a patch provided by Tim MiddelKoop to allow printing of proxy objects
- Added the contrib directory and included a medusa implementation of a 
  SOAP.py server by Ng Pheng Siong


VERSION 0.9.6 (6/08/01)

- The date and time types now check their initial values when the type
  is created, not when the data is marshalled.
- The date and time types are now parsed and returned as tuples (for
  multi-element types) or scalars (for single element types) in UTC and thus
  can represent the entire range of SOAP dates.
- If an element doesn't have a type but has a name with a namespace, the
  name is tried as the type.
- Untyped compound types with more than one element and all the elements
  the same name are turned into an array when parsing.
- When parsing a structType, elements with the same name are placed in a
  list instead of saving just the last one. _getItemsAsList can be used to
  get an element of a structure as a list, whether there was one or many
  occurances of the item.
- Added schemaNamespace, schemaNamespaceURI, and namespaceStyle
  configuration options. namespaceStyle takes one of 1999, 2000, or 2001,
  and sets typesNamespace, typesNamespaceURI, schemaNamespace, and
  schemaNamespaceURI.
- Normalized the type class names, replacing Compound with compoundType,
  Struct with structType, Header with headerType, Body with bodyType, Array
  with arrayType, TypedArray with typedArrayType, Fault with faultType, and
  urType with anyType.
- Attributes now appear on an element itself instead of the element's
  parent. For elements parsed to builtin python types, the attributes are
  stored in a dictionary keyed by the element's python id. The dictionary
  is in the Context object, can be returned from parseSOAP*, and can be
  returned from method calls if the returnAllAttrs configuration option
  is set.
- isinstance is used to check for a class, so classes can be subtyped.
- An encoding of None can be specified to not include encoding information.
- Problems with the SOAPProxy URL are now reported when the SOAPProxy
  instance is created instead of when the first method call is made.
- The Binary, Boolean and DateTime types have been removed in favor of
  binaryType, booleanType, and dateTimeType.


VERSION 0.9.5 (5/16/01)

- Should parse and build all 1999, 2000, 2001, and SOAP-ENC datatypes.
- Initial handling of multi-dimensional, partial, and sparse arrays.
- Supports SSL clients (if Python built with OpenSSL).
- Supports SSL servers (if M2Crypto installed).
- Applies defaults to SOAPproxy URLs (nice for command-line tools).
- Added the _SOAPContext object, gives registered server functions more info
  about the current call.
- Now assumes that any type that isn't in a schema could be a struct.
- Added the Config object, now config options can be set globally or on an
  individual call level.
- Deprecated the DateTime, Binary and Boolean types, should now 
  use dateTimeType, binaryType and booleanType.
- Includes N+I interop suite.
- Various bug fixes and improvements.
